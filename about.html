      <h3>Work Distribution and Collaboration</h3>
      <p>Our team collaborated closely to ensure an efficient and effective development process. Muhammad Sadeed Ali focused primarily on designing and implementing the user interface across the website, including layout, responsive design, and styling. Waleed Ahmed developed the JavaScript logic for product browsing, searching, filtering, and managing the shopping cart and checkout process. Abu Bakar was responsible for creating the admin dashboard, handling product management features such as adding, editing, and deleting products, and setting the foundation for backend integration with PHP and MySQL.</p>
      <p>We used version control via GitHub to coordinate changes and communicated regularly through team meetings to align on progress and resolve challenges.</p>

      <h3>Project Highlights</h3>
      <p>One of the key highlights of our project is the dynamic product filtering and sorting system on the products page, allowing users to quickly find items by category, price, or name. The theme toggle feature offers a seamless light/dark mode experience enhancing user comfort. We also implemented a fully functional shopping cart with quantity adjustment and removal capabilities, providing a realistic e-commerce experience.</p>
      <p>The admin page allows easy product management with intuitive controls for adding new items and updating existing ones, all managed via the frontend using localStorage as a placeholder for backend storage. This setup prepares us well for future integration with PHP and MySQL in upcoming assignments.</p>

      <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
      <p>During development, we faced challenges with maintaining data consistency across pages without a backend database, which led us to utilize localStorage extensively for state persistence. Implementing dynamic filtering and sorting required careful planning to optimize performance and user experience.</p>
      <p>Coordinating the JavaScript code across multiple scripts while keeping the global namespace clean also required us to modularize our code effectively. Time management was critical as we balanced project work with other course commitments.</p>
